**Hello!** 

This is a Repository for Bare Metal Device Drivers for TIVA Series Board TM4C123GXL Evaluation Board.
I have built this repo mainly to get the hand-on learning of Bare Metal Programming by reading the datasheets of Components, Microcontroller etc.,.

I will update the repo as needed whenever possible. It has basic GPIO to Communication Protocol Drivers.
Please feel free to fork the library or clone it.

If you want to contribute to the project, Please do make a pull request and send the results, will merge it into master.

Thank you.
